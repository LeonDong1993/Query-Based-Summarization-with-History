# Query-Based-Summarization-with-History
This is a course project for CS6301-Deep Learning in NLP (Spring 2023) at UT Dallas. In this project, we aim to boost the query-based summarization performance by utilizing the most related query and its summary from query histories. We fine-tuned BART model and conducted several experiments using a meeting summarization task.
